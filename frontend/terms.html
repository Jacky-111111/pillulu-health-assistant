      <h1>Terms of Educational Use and Privacy Notice</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Purpose of This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Pillulu Health Assistant is an educational software project designed to help users organize medication information quickly and conveniently.
        It is intended to support learning, daily tracking, and better awareness of medication routines.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is built for reference and convenience only. It does not provide diagnosis, treatment plans, emergency recommendations,
        or personalized clinical decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Not Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>
        Information shown in this app, including AI-generated responses and medication details, should not be treated as professional medical advice.
        The content may be incomplete, generalized, or outdated for your specific condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always consult a licensed doctor, pharmacist, nurse practitioner, or other qualified healthcare professional for real medical guidance,
        especially before starting, stopping, or changing any medication.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Recommendation to Contact Human Professionals</h2>
      <p>
        We strongly encourage users to maintain regular contact with real healthcare providers. Human professionals can assess your full medical history,
        allergies, interactions, lab results, and urgent symptoms in ways no educational app can fully replace.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>For urgent symptoms or emergencies, contact local emergency services immediately.</li>
        <li>For dosage and interaction questions, speak to your pharmacist or prescribing clinician.</li>
        <li>For long-term care and chronic disease management, follow your licensed care team.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Privacy and Data Handling Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        Pillulu Health Assistant is designed with a privacy-conscious approach. The project aims to minimize unnecessary personal data collection
        and to avoid sharing user data for advertising or unrelated profiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not intentionally disclose your private information to unauthorized parties. We focus on storing only the information needed
        to provide core features such as account login, medication reminders, and profile settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we make reasonable efforts to protect data, no online system can guarantee absolute security.
        Users should still use strong passwords and avoid entering highly sensitive details that are not required by the app.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Convenience and User Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        This tool is built to make medication tracking more convenient and faster to use in everyday life. However, users remain responsible
        for verifying important health decisions with qualified clinicians and for checking the accuracy of medication instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using this app, you acknowledge that the service is a helper for reference and organization, not a substitute for licensed medical care.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By creating an account or continuing to use Pillulu Health Assistant, you confirm that you have read and accepted these terms,
        including the educational-use limitation and privacy notice.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Contact for Questions and Suggestions</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions, feedback, or suggestions about Pillulu Health Assistant, please contact us.
        We welcome ideas that can improve usability, clarity, and safety for all users.
