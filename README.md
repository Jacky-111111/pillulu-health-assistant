## Run Locally

Run **backend** and **frontend** separately in local dev.

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `.env` in `backend/` with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, and email settings for Resend (see `backend/.env.example`).

Key email-related vars:

- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key
- `FROM_EMAIL` - Verified sender in Resend

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Frontend

In a **new terminal**:

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8080
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The frontend uses `API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000` when on localhost.

### Notes

- If you update DB-backed profile/pillbox fields, restart backend once to allow SQLite auto-migrations to run.
- Camera scan requires browser camera permission and works best on HTTPS or localhost.
- The Notifications section includes a multi-email editor UI in the frontend. It is currently a **mock/local-only** UI and is not yet wired to backend delivery logic.

## Deployment

- **Merged (recommended):** One Render Web Service serves both frontend and API. See `backend/README.md` for config (Root Directory empty, Build/Start from `backend/`).
- **Cron:** Render Cron Job → POST `/api/cron/send_reminders` with `X-CRON-SECRET`

See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for details.

## Secrets

Never commit: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `.env`
